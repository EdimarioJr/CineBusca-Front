### About this project

The idea of the App is:
"Find your next movie or create your watchlist with this App. It include rating, actors and anything you need to know about the movie."

The project was made for studies purposes, and to be part of my portfolio.

### The user stories:

   - User can see all the latest movie on the front page
   - User scroll down to see all other movies according to popularity
   - User can click on any of the movie to go to their own separate page
   - User can then see all about the movie ratings, about, actors present on each separate movie page
   - User can see recommended movies based in the movie he clicked on the separated movie page
   - User can create an account
   - User can create their own watch list
   - User can review movies

### Observations:
   1. The data about all movies was taken from the [Movie DB Api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
